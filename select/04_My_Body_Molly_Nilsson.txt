I love mybody
Like nobody
Could ever love
Anybody

I love my body
'Cause it's mine
But I didn't always
Love it all the time
It's as good as any body
You would find
It fights for me
And it nurtures my mind

I had a dream that changed my life
Or maybe life changed what I dreamed of
It's the only thing that keeps me alive
Now that's what I call love

I love mybody
Like nobody
Could ever love
Anybody

I love my body
Like nobody
Could ever love it
'Cause it's mine

I love mybody
Like nobody
Could ever love
Anybody
